# Iris-flowers

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician, eugenicist, and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis. It is sometimes called Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspé Peninsula "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus".Fisher's paper was published in the journal, the Annals of Eugenics, creating controversy about the continued use of the Iris dataset for teaching statistical techniques today.

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other.

The columns in this dataset are:

Id \ SepalLengthCm \ SepalWidthCm \ PetalLengthCm \ PetalWidthCm \ Species.

## Description

I created this repositry to test different approches of machine learning techniques on the Iris flower data set and there is another reason that there was a task applied to me from the Sparks Foundation internship, so you will see three different Notebooks based on this dataset each of them applied different technique with good explaination of it:
### 1. Iris flowers classification

In this Notebook I applied different classification algorithms to see which of them will give the higher accuracy of its prediction, and of course I made comparison of the reuslts of each one of algrothims I applied.

### 2. Iris flowers clustering

This Notebook was for a task, so the requirements was to predict the optimum number of the clusters and represent it visually. I implemeted the K-means Clustering algorthim and before that I made some Exploratory Data Analysis to understand the data more in-depth. Then I explained how to implement the K-means Clustering and to do that I explained how choose the number of clusters k because we assume that we don't know labels because we deal with unsupervised learning problem here, so based on that we must not know the number of clusters k.

### 3. Decision_tree

This Notebook also was for a task, and the requirements was to create a Decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically. I started by explaining what is the decision tree ? what Decision tree consist of ? how does it work ? then I implemented it, then visualize it graphically.

#### Commens in these Notebooks

1. How to impelement algorthims using the Python Scikit-Learn library ?
2. What are the required Packages for each algorthim ?
3. Simple comments in each essential cell.
4. Basic steps to be considered when you’re implementing algorthim (Headings).
5. Almost the same metrics used to evaluate algorthims.
